# mystery-clock

This repository contains Arduino code for a 3D-printed “Mystery Clock.”  The code is for the [Waveshare RP2040-Zero](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-zero.htm) microcontroller board.  See the [Mystery Clock project](https://makerworld.com/en/models/764838) on MakerWorld.  The code also works for the [Hollow Clock 4 Remix project](https://makerworld.com/en/models/875220) on MakerWorld.

The code file `mystery-clock-uln.ino` is for the ULN2003 driver board described in both MakerWorld projects.  Also available is an optional [improved custom driver board](https://github.com/engworkshop/clock-driver-board) with greater timekeeping accuracy and quieter motor operation.
