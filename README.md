# mystery-clock

This repository contains Arduino code for a 3D-printed “Mystery Clock.”  The code is for the [Waveshare RP2040-Zero](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-zero.htm) microcontroller board.  See the [clock project on MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/764838).

The code file `mystery-clock-uln.ino` is for the ULN2003 driver board described in the MakerWorld project.  An [improved custom driver board](https://github.com/engworkshop/clock-driver-board) with greater timekeeping accuracy and quieter motor operation is also available.
